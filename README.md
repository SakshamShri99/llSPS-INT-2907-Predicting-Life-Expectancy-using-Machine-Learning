Predicting Life Expectancy using Machine Learning

Life expectancy is a statistical measure of the average time an organism is expected to live,
based on the year of its birth, its current age, and other demographic factors including gender.
      In order to predict life expectancy rate of a given country, we will be using Machine 
Learning algorithms to draw inferences from the given dataset and give an output. For better
usability by the customer, we are also going to be creating a UI for the user to interact with 
using Node-Red.
        This project tries to create a modal that predict the life expectancy of different 
countries in years provided by data of WHO. This data offers a timeframe from 200 to 2015.
This helps to determine the life expectancy of a region and to take necessary medical precautions
if there are any diseases.
